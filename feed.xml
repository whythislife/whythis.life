    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to work backwards from the thought about understanding feminism intuitively. (It was a long walk back from Parkdale). Nothing in particular happened, but I&amp;#8217;ve been reading a lot of posts surrounding the #metoo tag. I understand it intellectually with respect to things like the wage gap, performative expectations in family and in public, and increased expectations in general. In addition to that it&amp;#8217;s also necessary to be on guard a lot of the time, and not just physically either.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to work backwards from the thought about understanding feminism intuitively. (It was a long walk back from Parkdale). Nothing in particular happened, but I&amp;#8217;ve been reading a lot of posts surrounding the #metoo tag. I understand it intellectually with respect to things like the wage gap, performative expectations in family and in public, and increased expectations in general. In addition to that it&amp;#8217;s also necessary to be on guard a lot of the time, and not just physically either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was regarding equality and gender discrimination. It&amp;#8217;s obvious writing it out, but I know for a fact that I&amp;#8217;ve formed initial opinions and notions about people based on their gender. It&amp;#8217;s often gone unchecked and unacknowledged, because I kept telling myself well of course I knew better. Not making assumptions requires vigilance. Equality in my mind means treating people like I&amp;#8217;d want to be treated and for the most part have stuck to that, and yet haven&amp;#8217;t really done anything to actively make things MORE equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m 100% certain I&amp;#8217;ve never sexually assaulted somebody. Once again though theres more nuance, and doesn&amp;#8217;t take into consideration things like leering, malegazing, unsolicited conversation, touching and simple proximity. Some/all of these I&amp;#8217;ve definitely done. There are other things that I wasn&amp;#8217;t really aware of, like why asking a woman out on a date while she&amp;#8217;s at work is a bad idea (can&amp;#8217;t just leave), or how jokes can normalize abuse. It sucks that women have to basically be on guard a lot of the time, so it follows logically that men have to be on guard too, and call out sexist language and abuse as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I realized I&amp;#8217;ve been looking at this topic intellectually instead of more actively being mindful of my language, actions, intentions and assumptions. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what other actionable items look like yet, but I&amp;#8217;m giving it a lot of long, hard thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
