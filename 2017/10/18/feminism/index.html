  		<p>I&#8217;m going to work backwards from the thought about understanding feminism intuitively. (It was a long walk back from Parkdale). Nothing in particular happened, but I&#8217;ve been reading a lot of posts surrounding the #metoo tag. I understand it intellectually with respect to things like the wage gap, performative expectations in family and in public, and increased expectations in general. In addition to that it&#8217;s also necessary to be on guard a lot of the time, and not just physically either.</p>

<p>My first thought was regarding equality and gender discrimination. It&#8217;s obvious writing it out, but I know for a fact that I&#8217;ve formed initial opinions and notions about people based on their gender. It&#8217;s often gone unchecked and unacknowledged, because I kept telling myself well of course I knew better. Not making assumptions requires vigilance. Equality in my mind means treating people like I&#8217;d want to be treated and for the most part have stuck to that, and yet haven&#8217;t really done anything to actively make things MORE equal.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m 100% certain I&#8217;ve never sexually assaulted somebody. Once again though theres more nuance, and doesn&#8217;t take into consideration things like leering, malegazing, unsolicited conversation, touching and simple proximity. Some/all of these I&#8217;ve definitely done. There are other things that I wasn&#8217;t really aware of, like why asking a woman out on a date while she&#8217;s at work is a bad idea (can&#8217;t just leave), or how jokes can normalize abuse. It sucks that women have to basically be on guard a lot of the time, so it follows logically that men have to be on guard too, and call out sexist language and abuse as it happens.</p>

<p>Ultimately I realized I&#8217;ve been looking at this topic intellectually instead of more actively being mindful of my language, actions, intentions and assumptions. I&#8217;m not sure what other actionable items look like yet, but I&#8217;m giving it a lot of long, hard thought.</p>
